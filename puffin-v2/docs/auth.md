## Different Login system
<b> User Story </b>:  An user who wants to register inside your apps to start using your services. 

Depends on the business nature, you may want to have different registration system for your users to register. We have the below list of registrations available in the app
- Facebook Registration: An user can use their facebook login to signin/signup
- Google Registration: An user can use their Google login to signin/signup
- Native email registration : An user can just any email which is not connected to 3rd party logins to Signin/signup
- Phone number based registration: An user can signin/signup using their phone number with OTP verification in their first registration. In the subsequent signin, the verified phone number and password can be used to signin.

In the subsequent documentation, we will mostly use terms and explanation based on typical retail marketplaces.
