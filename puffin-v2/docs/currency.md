Multi Currency

![Currency Management](/img/currency-management.png)
Currently you can configure different currency on top of your default currency. 

Let's use USD to MYR as example
- Names can be just ISO Currency code or Name of the currency. EXAMPLE: MYR or Malaysian Ringgit
- CODE: MYR 
- Exchange Rate: If your base currency is USD and you are adding MYR as currency. It should be the conversion from USD to MYR. 
- FORMAT: You can format how you want the currency should look like with the amount in front end apps. Example: @ {amount}. Here '@' -> you an replace any symbols here. It could be a dollar or a unicode symbol
