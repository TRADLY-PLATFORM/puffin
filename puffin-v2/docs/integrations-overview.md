** FAQ **
1. ** Do I need these extensions? ** - No not all the extensions are needed for you. In each extensions we recommend which one is mandatory to have, recommended to have and optional to have.

2. ** Do I need to pay for extensions providers? ** 
Most of the extensions we choose are free, have charges only after a certain usage. So you might not need to pay for it until you cross the threshhold 

3. **What should I do if I need extensions? ** 
You can create free accounts(details on each extension page) whichever you need and update those credentials under your superadmin panel for us to retrieve whenever we provide app updates and launches for you. 

4. **Does extensions start collecting data or allow you to use the features when you activate in superadmin panel? ** Not all of them. Some get activated in real time and some are activated only when we update the apps or launch apps in respective stores. 

5. **Do you charge for the extensions integrations? ** 
We try to integrate as many extensions for free based on most users needs progressively. However we cannot promise that one you expect will be available for free. If you don't find in our list, it will not be available and need to be integrated with additional charges. When we quote for any implementation, we quote and charge only 10% of the estimation. Example: For integration a new payment gateway which is not in our existing list, we charge $300 instead of $3000. 

6. **Do you charge for the extensions by users or transaction? ** 
We don't charge anything expect integrations. You will be directly paying to the vendor for additional usage charges. Hence, we will always ask you to open the account through your own emails and payment details. Most of the extensions are supported by well known industry players, so their support are better.
