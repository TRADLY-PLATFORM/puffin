## Youtube Channel
We were bit delayed in the space of demonstrating our products in a clear way. We believe our initiative of making more videos can give more clarity and deeper view on how our solution works. 
We are planning to add the channel with more videos on other topics like
- Platform Economy
- Building and Growing a Marketplace
- Do subscribe > [Tradly Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRpXlfFBX5nayubY70-IFEA/)


## New pricing for Developers

From the day one our goal is to build an API first solution for the digital commerce revolution. It’s going to take long time to fulfil that goal. However, We are having a good start

- Whereby we have our headless API first version released with free sandbox account
- API in postman collection as of now
- Production environment starts just at $49.

## Opensourcing Hummingbird

We are working on open sourcing our hummingbird, ReactJS web app that is connected with our API. Benefits are
- Developers can launch this on their own server like other ReactJS and own the production
- This can serve as a good boilerplate instead of building something on their own. Fast to the market.
- In a month, we are planning to release the V1. If you would like to contribute, let us know.



That’s all what we have. Let us know if there is any feedbacks. Again hope you are doing good 😊
