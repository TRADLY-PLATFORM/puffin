As everybusiness you will have a website domain as primary URL for different activities. Below is the list of things we need from your side

## Domain Verification 
The below picture provide why we need domain verification. **This is applicable for apps which are using email based registration**
- Add the domain name in the superadmin (Feature is still in testing, Request via support portal for the change)

## Add TXT 
- Go to your domain registar, access the DNS settings 
- Add the TXT record, your superadmin should show a TXT record for to enter in your DNS settings 

Example: Below pic
