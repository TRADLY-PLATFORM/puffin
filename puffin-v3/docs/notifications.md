- Green means the seller can change the order status, and the green box means the message is being sent from the seller to the buyer.
- Yellow colour means that the buyer can change the order status, and the yellow box means the message is being from the seller to the buyer.

Note: Mid of 2021, you'll be able to change the messages from SuperAdmin panel. However we recommend you to keep the standard and share in your FAQ documents, so your customers can refer. Secondly, when the logistics partner is integrated, there will be additional status (from logistics/shipping partners) for customers to find exact realtime locations, etc.
