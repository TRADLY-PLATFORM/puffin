## Vision behind Tradly's Edutech Marketplace
Our vision: An educational infrastructure that helps individuals get an education without regard to location or socioeconomic standing. We want our platform to be accessible to all and to fit multiple preferences and ideas. 

The reason behind this platform is to improve student outcomes, enhance individualized education, and reduce teaching burden from instructors.  According to the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS),  the ratio of students to teachers is approximately 25:1, which is an echoing burden in every country. 

We are creating an instructor to student learning marketplace platform. Instructors can sell individual tutoring based on their preferences, and students can select tutors based on their preferences. All tutoring lessons can be filtered by category, price, education of instructor, days of the week available, etc.              

Tradly Edutech believes in education for all.


## About Tradly Edutech Marketplace

Tradly's Edutech marketplace is the premier provider of platforms that can be used by organizations, schools, and individuals to connect students to education. In the world, the ratio of students to teachers is 25:1, therefore students are not getting enough attention from instructors and are academically behind in certain areas. Tradly's Edutech marketplace is designed so that students can get immediate access to tutors 24/7 for a wide variety of needs, all from a click of a button. 

We streamline the process so that the only thing you have to do is customize your service, after that the students are immediately connected with tutors on a case-by-case basis. Our marketplace is optimized so that students and tutors have customizable profiles, which means that one on one connections are created on a day to day basis. 


Students have a wide variety of learning styles and learning abilities, and Tradly's Edutech Marketplace believes on creating a match that is sustainable and satisfactory for both parties.


We aim to eliminate the " one size fits all " stereotype in education, and give power to students to choose how they learn.

## One-on-One learning

One-on-one learning is all about forming a learning connection between a student and a teacher. In this model, you will have a mentoring infrastructure in which it is just one on one sessions. This form of structure is great for students who have specific problems/problem areas, or simply just need that one-on-one time to digest a concept.

It also lets the teacher adapt their teaching style to a specific student learning style, causing maximum retention and understanding. It is also a low-stress environment where the student does not have to worry about the academic level of their peers, they simply have the freedom to ask whatever they want whenever they want. This is a level of high-quality attention that every student requires in the classroom, whether they need help or not.

Students may also get personalized problems and assignments to take home to show mastery in their progress.


This increase in personal attention is meant to skyrocket learning and scores, making the student into life-long learners! 

PS: If you are going to build something on top of Tradly API, this is how an example app might function like.
